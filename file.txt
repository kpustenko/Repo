TortoiseSVN is a free open-source client for the Subversion version control system
That is, TortoiseSVN manages files and directories over time. 
Files are stored in a central repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server, except that it remembers every change ever made to your files and directories
This allows you to recover older versions of your files and examine the history of how and when your data changed, and who changed it.
